# DSA-Java

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, following [Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-questions/).

## 📌 Purpose

To build strong problem-solving skills and prepare for product-based interviews by solving curated problems in a structured, topic-wise manner.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Sorting Techniques
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Recursion
- Stack & Queue
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation

## 🛠️ Approach

- Each problem includes:
  - ✅ Clean Java implementation
  - ✅ Time and space complexity
  - ✅ Brute-force and optimal solutions (where applicable)
  - ✅ Test cases inside `main()` for verification
- Code is written and tested in VS Code
- Pushed daily with clear commit messages
